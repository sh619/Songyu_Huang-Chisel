# Songyu_Huang-Chisel
A project on implementing CPU on FPGA using Chisel
# Implement MU0 cpu using Chisel
The initial attempt is to set up the Chisel bootcamp
Progress update:
1st July to 7th July:
Initial reaserch on MU0 cpu and organising Quartus file. In order to run the MU0 design on FPGA, I need to change the current Quartus file to the suitable version to make sure the designed CPU can run on MAX10 PFGA. When trying to connect the FPGA to Quartus vis USB blaster, Quartus cannot recognize the FPGA board. After searching online, I found out that this maybe caused by other USB devices connected to the PC.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59866887/124550922-ff393580-de63-11eb-8a4a-ea62713121fc.png)
