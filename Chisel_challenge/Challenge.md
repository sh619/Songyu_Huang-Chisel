The specification of your circuit is:  
1. The circuit is triggered (or started) by pressing KEY[1] (donâ€™t forget KEY[1] is low active);  
2. The 10 LEDs (above the slide switches) will then start lighting up from left to right at 0.5 second interval, until all LEDs are ON;  
3. The circuit then waits for a random period of time between 0.25 and 16 seconds before all LEDs turn OFF;  
4. You should also display the random delay period in milliseconds on five 7-segment displays.
