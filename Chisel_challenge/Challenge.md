7.27 —— 8.1 Complete the f1 LED challenge using chisel
# Description
The goal in this Challenge is to design a Formula 1 style of race starting lights.  
The link below is to a YouTube video on a similar light with sound. (Sound is not required for this Challenge.

Use chisel to complete the challenge
     
The specification of the circuit is:  
1. The circuit is triggered (or started) by pressing KEY[1];  
2. The 10 LEDs (above the slide switches) will then start lighting up from left to right at 0.5 second interval, until all LEDs are ON;  
3. The circuit then waits for a random period of time between 0.25 and 16 seconds before all LEDs turn OFF;  
4. You should also display the random delay period in milliseconds on five 7-segment displays.
5. The circuit should count the time between all the LEDs turning OFF and you pressing KEY[0]. The reaction time should be displayed on the 7-segment displays in milliseconds in place of the random delay
